All authors of accepted manuscripts are welcome to submit ideas for the cover. Although the submission may be based on or resemble the figures in the article, your images should be both artistic and informative. Feel free to submit several different images for consideration. The editors make their selection based on both the aesthetic quality of the image and the scientific quality of the study. Please try to make your submissions interesting and creative, and consider the following when submitting files:

- Images that look like simple reproductions of figures from the journal will most likely not be selected for the cover.
- We must have the permission of the copyright holder of any copyrighted images.
- Editors use your suggestions of headlines and legends to help them choose the images.
- Please label both low- and high-resolution files as follows: “Manuscript Number\_Corresponding Author Name.” For additional cover submissions, please include a number at the end of the file name.
- If you use the cover image template below to help create your images, do not flatten the layers.

Please provide all of the following when submitting cover files:

1. **A high-resolution PSD or TIF file for each submission (labeled as "Manuscript Number\_Corresponding Author Name")**
2. **A lower-quality PDF or JPG copy:**
- labeled as "Manuscript Number\_Corresponding Author Name"
	- that is no larger than 1 MB
	- that contains the first and corresponding author names in the upper-right corner of the image
4. **A single-page Word document containing:**
- your author list
	- article title
	- a cover legend (a brief paragraph, no more than 75 words, that describes the cover image and relates it to the major findings of your article)
	- a sentence giving credit to the person who made the cover, if appropriate
	- corresponding author email address

- Please make sure that the digital files are large enough to fit the journal cover, which prints at **8 1/8 x 10 7/8 inches**.
- The high-resolution file should have a resolution of **at least 300 dpi**. Please submit a  **PSD or TIF** file that fits our size and resolution requirements, described below (preferably with layers).
- You may wish to download and use our [cover image template](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/platform/cover-image-templates/xcrm-cover-template-1743095973917.tif). This.tif file shows the exact layout of our cover, including the logo, trim lines, and spine width. You may wish to use this to help with your layout or to make sure that your images are sized correctly to fit the cover and spine. If you use the file, please do not flatten the layers, as we must be able to access your images without the text and logo, etc.

To send us files via FTP, we strongly recommend using FTP software rather than your web browser. Our FTP details are as follows:

- Host server: sftp://ftp.tnq.co.in
- Username: cell-covers
- Password: @!Br2n6j!2#yeswU
- Directory: XCRM

After uploading your files, please send a notification email to the production editor ([https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/contact](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/contact)). In the email, please be sure to give the name(s) of the files or folders and specify which manuscript they are associated with.

If you need more help or the timing is urgent, please contact our production team. However, please note that in most cases we cannot give detailed technical help and may ask that you contact your local IT department if you are having technical problems.

Please consider copyright issues when submitting your ideas. For any work that is under copyright, you must obtain written permission from the rightsholder to use the images. We cannot use images for which permission has not been obtained. If you purchase images from an artist, illustrator, or stock photography agency, we will ask for a copy of the agreement so that we can make sure that we have the permission to use the image.

We do not ask for copyright of the images to be assigned to us, but we do ask for a nonexclusive license to use the image. A copy of our license [can be found here](https://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/forms/cover-license-1706291480437.pdf).

It can be difficult to set a deadline for cover image submissions because the scheduling of articles will sometimes change during production. In general, it is best to send your submission as quickly as possible after the paper is accepted. If this is not possible, you should at least express your interest to the production team ([doesterle@cell.com](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/)) after your article is formally accepted. We may be able to give you a better idea of submission deadlines. Cover images are usually selected within three weeks of your paper's acceptance.
