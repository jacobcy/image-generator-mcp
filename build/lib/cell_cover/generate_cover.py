Cell Cover Generator - Core Module (Placeholder)
-----------------------------------------------
This file is largely obsolete after refactoring.
The main entry point is now cli.py.
Argument parsing, initialization, and command dispatching are handled in cli.py.
Command logic resides in the 'commands' sub-package.
Utility functions are in the 'utils' sub-package.

# Removed most imports as they are no longer needed here
import os
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# --- Constants that *might* be needed by utils if not passed directly ---
# SCRIPT_DIR definition might be needed if utils rely on it and it's not recalculated there
# SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# --- Removed Global Variables ---
# logger instance is created in cli.py
# config_manager might be handled differently now

# --- Removed Function Definitions ---
# All command handlers and main function are removed.
# Utility functions are in ./utils/

# Load environment variables if utils still rely on this happening here?
# It's better if utils requiring env vars load them directly or receive them.
# load_dotenv()

# This file can likely be deleted after verifying cli.py works correctly.
